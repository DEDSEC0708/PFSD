        <h1>Maha Shivaratri Festival</h1>
        <p>Maha Shivaratri is a significant Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva, the destroyer of evil. Devotees observe fasts, visit Shiva temples, and perform religious rituals with deep devotion.</p>
        <p>It is believed that observing Maha Shivaratri with sincerity purifies the soul and brings blessings. Temples are adorned with flowers, and devotees offer milk, water, and Bilva leaves to the Shiva Lingam, seeking Lord Shiva's grace.</p>
